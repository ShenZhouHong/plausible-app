The installation of Plausible Analytics is now complete 

You must now complete setup by **registering an admin account.**

Please do so immediately via $CLOUDRON-APP-ORIGIN .

Plausible has additional configuration options which may be set in a file located at `/app/data/plausible-conf.env`. You can modify this file using Cloudron's file manager. These options include Google's Search Console Integration, setting a custom GeoIP database, and more. Documentation for these settings are available at [Plausible's website](https://plausible.io/docs/self-hosting-configuration#ip-geolocation). These configuration settings will be activated upon restarting the Cloudron app.
