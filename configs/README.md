# Configuration File Templates for Plausible, Clickhouse, & Supervisor

This directory contains the configuration file templates for the Plausible server, the Clickhouse database, and the Supervisor daemon which runs and manages both processes. Files in this directory are copied over to the correct locations during the Docker build process defined in the `./Dockerfile` at the repository root.
